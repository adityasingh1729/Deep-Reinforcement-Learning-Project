    "## Solving Tic-Tac-Toe using TD(λ)\n",
    "In this assignment you will build an RL agent capable of playing Tic-Tac-Toe using TD(λ) algorithm and the environment simulated by you in first week.\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all copy the environment simulated by you from the first week below.\n",
    "- Note that you should also return the state of the board each time you call act function, ideally the state should be stored in a numpy array for faster implementation\n",
    "- The only input the function can take is via its own arguments and not input() function.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ideal TicTacToe environment:\n",
    "- Will take N, the size of board as an argument in its constructor.\n",
    "- Will have act function taking a single argument representing the action taken (preferably int type) and return the state of board (preferably numpy array), reward signal (float) and bool value \"done\" which is true if the game is over else false.\n",
    "- Will have reset function which resets the board and starts a new game.\n",
    "- Will give reward signal as 1 if 'X' won and -1 if 'O' won (or vice-versa) and 0 if its a draw.\n",
    "- Will take alternate calls of act function as the moves of one player.\n",
